# Autolink: Intelligent Network Automation PoC

> **Advanced Browser Automation & Human-Like Intelligence Simulation**

Autolink is a sophisticated technical proof-of-concept demonstrating the power of agentic browser automation within a controlled environment. It simulates high-fidelity human interactions to manage professional network growth with precision and stealth.

## 🚀 Key Presentation Features

### 1. Agentic Workflow Intelligence
Unlike standard scripts, Autolink performs complex decision-making:
- **Direct Search Operations**: Connects with targets directly from search results using attribute-based targeting (`data-id` synchronization).
- **Proactive Engagement**: Automatically detects accepted connections and initiates personalized welcome DMs.
- **Intelligent Skip Logic**: Multi-layered check (Search UI, Local DB, Session State) to avoid redundant requests.

### 2. Radical Stealth & Human Simulation
Built on top of `go-rod` and custom-tuned behavior models:
- **Variable Jitter Typing**: Emulates realistic typing speeds with randomized pauses and "thinking" delays.
- **Non-Linear Mouse Navigation**: Avoids robotic pathways by utilizing human-like movement arcs.
- **Fingerprint Evasion**: Full stealth plugin integration to bypass basic bot detection metrics.

### 3. Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Go (Golang) for high-performance concurrency.
- **Automation**: `go-rod` + `stealth` plugin for browser control.
- **State Management**: SQL-based persistence for cross-session reliable memory.
- **UI Architecture**: Glassmorphism-inspired "Intelligence Dashboard" for real-time monitoring.

## 🛠️ Performance & Scalability
- **Handshake Dispatch**: < 2s verification cycle.
- **Network Sync**: Sub-second synchronization with protocol database.
- **Safety protocols**: Hard-capped daily quotas and inter-action cooldowns.
